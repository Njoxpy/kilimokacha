For AgroConnect's **category layout**, **search input box**, **search button**, and **blog sections**, here's a breakdown of color usage based on Material Design guidelines, including background (bg) colors, text colors, and interactive states such as hover and active:

### 1. **Category Layout**
You want a clean, intuitive layout that aligns with the agriculture theme and reflects simplicity and functionality.

- **Background Color (BG)**:  
  Use **soft green tones** for the background, symbolizing agriculture and nature. For example:
  - Light Green (`#E8F5E9`): Can be used for the main category background to keep it subtle and comfortable for the eyes.
  - White (`#FFFFFF`): For card backgrounds or sections to contrast well with the green background.
  
- **Text Colors**:  
  Use dark or neutral tones for legibility:
  - Dark Green (`#2E7D32`): For main headers or category titles to keep it aligned with the green theme.
  - Dark Gray (`#242833`): For category descriptions or secondary text, as it is a neutral color and ensures good contrast with lighter backgrounds.

- **States (Hover, Active)**:
  - **Hover**: Slight darkening or shading of category backgrounds or underlining text for interaction feedback. E.g., hover effect on cards can be:
    - Light Green Darkened (`#A5D6A7`).
  - **Active**: A stronger darkening effect or slight shadowing on categories to signal an active click or selection. E.g.:
    - Deep Green (`#388E3C`).

### 2. **Search Input Box**
The search input should be easy to interact with and visually appealing.

- **Background Color (BG)**:
  - Soft Gray (`#F5F5F5`): For the input field background to maintain subtlety.
  
- **Border**:
  - Medium Gray (`#BDBDBD`): For a thin border around the search box, keeping it light and non-intrusive.

- **Text Colors**:
  - Dark Gray (`#424242`): For the placeholder and input text to ensure readability against the light background.
  
- **States (Hover, Active)**:
  - **Hover**: A slight border highlight or shadow for a more focused look:
    - Border Color: Green Tint (`#66BB6A`).
  - **Active**: A bolded border to indicate the active state:
    - Border Color: Dark Green (`#388E3C`).

### 3. **Search Button**
The search button should stand out but still feel cohesive with the overall design.

- **Background Color (BG)**:
  - Bright Green (`#66BB6A`): For the default state, symbolizing growth and action.
  
- **Text Colors**:
  - White (`#FFFFFF`): For the button text to ensure a strong contrast and readability.

- **States (Hover, Active)**:
  - **Hover**: Slight darkening of the button:
    - Dark Green (`#388E3C`).
  - **Active**: Use a darker green tone or apply a shadow effect to show it's being clicked:
    - Very Dark Green (`#2E7D32`).

### 4. **Blog Section**
The blog section can have a professional and clean appearance, with focus on readability.

- **Background Color (BG)**:
  - White (`#FFFFFF`): For the blog post container backgrounds to keep it clean and readable.
  
- **Text Colors**:
  - Title: Dark Green (`#2E7D32`): To keep the titles consistent with the category layout.
  - Body Text: Dark Gray (`#424242`): For the blog text to ensure easy readability.
  - Date and Author: Lighter Gray (`#757575`): For metadata to make it less prominent but still visible.

- **States (Hover, Active)**:
  - **Hover**: Blog post titles can underline or slightly change color when hovered, like:
    - Light Green (`#66BB6A`).
  - **Active**: Same effect as hover but slightly stronger:
    - Dark Green (`#388E3C`).

### Overall Color Scheme Summary:
- **Primary Colors**: Shades of Green (`#E8F5E9`, `#66BB6A`, `#388E3C`) to reflect agriculture and sustainability.
- **Secondary Colors**: Shades of Gray (`#242833`, `#BDBDBD`, `#424242`) to maintain a neutral, clean look for text and borders.
- **Text**: Consistent use of dark gray and dark green for headers and body text.
