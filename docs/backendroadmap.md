Hereâ€™s a 3-week roadmap for working on the backend of the *Savarrah* project, assuming that the project is focused on a web application with a backend to handle various activities. This roadmap covers tasks like setting up the backend infrastructure, defining APIs, integrating with databases, and ensuring everything is ready for deployment. 

### **Week 1: Setup and Basic Infrastructure**
1. **Day 1-2: Project Setup and Environment**
   - **Set up project repository** (GitHub/Bitbucket/GitLab).
   - **Install necessary backend stack** (e.g., Node.js, Express, Django, etc.).
   - **Configure local development environment** (database setup, environment variables, etc.).
   - **Set up version control** (Git with a .gitignore for relevant files like `.env`).

2. **Day 3-4: Database Design and Setup**
   - **Design Database schema**: Determine entities and relationships (e.g., users, orders, products, etc.).
   - **Set up database** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
   - **Create database models and migrations** (using an ORM like Sequelize, Mongoose, or Django ORM).
   - **Test database connections** and create necessary database tables/collections.

3. **Day 5-7: API Architecture and Routes Setup**
   - **Define API structure** (RESTful or GraphQL APIs).
   - **Create basic routes** (e.g., `/users`, `/products`, `/orders`).
   - **Set up route handling** in controllers for CRUD operations.
   - **Ensure validation** for incoming requests (e.g., using express-validator or similar).

### **Week 2: Core Functionality and Integration**
1. **Day 8-9: User Authentication and Authorization**
   - **Set up user authentication** (JWT, OAuth, or traditional sessions).
   - **Create login, register, and logout routes**.
   - **Create user roles and permissions** (e.g., admin, user, guest).
   - **Test authentication endpoints**.

2. **Day 10-11: Business Logic Implementation**
   - **Implement business logic for core features** (e.g., creating orders, managing products).
   - **Develop CRUD operations for main entities** (e.g., products, orders, categories).
   - **Create APIs for these features** and test each with Postman/Insomnia.

3. **Day 12-13: Integrate External Services** (if needed)
   - **Set up integration with external APIs** (e.g., payment gateways, email services).
   - **Test integration** and ensure data is sent/received properly.

4. **Day 14: Data Validation and Error Handling**
   - **Implement data validation** (both client-side and server-side).
   - **Handle errors** (e.g., 404, 500 errors) and return meaningful messages.
   - **Test API error handling**.

---

### **Week 3: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment**
1. **Day 15-16: Unit and Integration Testing**
   - **Write unit tests** for individual functions and API routes (e.g., using Mocha, Jest, or any testing framework).
   - **Write integration tests** to ensure that all parts of the system work together.
   - **Ensure database consistency** (test with dummy data, verify CRUD operations).

2. **Day 17: Performance and Security**
   - **Optimize database queries** (use indexing, optimize queries).
   - **Secure the backend** (e.g., prevent SQL Injection, XSS attacks).
   - **Enable CORS** and other security headers.
   - **Test for vulnerabilities** using tools like OWASP ZAP.

3. **Day 18-19: Deployment Preparation**
   - **Prepare backend for deployment** (e.g., set up a production-ready server).
   - **Set up environment variables for production**.
   - **Ensure API rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
   - **Set up logging** (e.g., Winston, Morgan) to monitor API activity.

4. **Day 20-21: Deployment and Monitoring**
   - **Deploy backend to a cloud provider** (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, Heroku, etc.).
   - **Monitor the deployed backend** (e.g., using tools like LogRocket, Datadog).
   - **Test deployed backend** in production environment.

This roadmap assumes you're working solo or with a small team, and it might need adjustments depending on the complexity of your *Savarrah* project or team size. Adjust tasks if you encounter unexpected roadblocks or need to spend more time on specific features.
