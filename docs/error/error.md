It looks like you're encountering an issue during your build process on Vercel. The error message at the end, `Error: No Output Directory named "build" found after the Build completed`, indicates that Vercel is unable to locate the expected output directory for your built files. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this:

### 1. **Check the Build Output Directory**

By default, Vercel expects a directory named `build` to contain the output files after the build completes. However, from the logs, it seems like you are using Vite, which usually outputs the files to a `dist` folder by default.

- **Change the Output Directory**: You can set the output directory in your Vercel project settings to match where Vite places its files. Follow these steps:
  - Go to your Vercel dashboard.
  - Navigate to your project settings.
  - Look for the **Output Directory** setting and set it to `dist`.

### 2. **Verify Your Build Command**

Ensure that your `package.json` has the correct build command. You should have something like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Update Your Vercel Configuration**

If you have a `vercel.json` file, you can explicitly define the output directory within it:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Address Deprecation Warnings**

While not directly causing the build failure, the warnings in your logs indicate that several packages you're using are deprecated. It's good practice to keep your dependencies up-to-date:

- Run `npm outdated` to see which packages have newer versions.
- Update them as needed, focusing especially on packages that are causing deprecation warnings.

### 5. **Re-deploy Your Project**

After making these changes, try redeploying your project on Vercel to see if the error persists.

If you're still having issues after trying these suggestions, feel free to share more details about your project setup, and I can provide further assistance!
